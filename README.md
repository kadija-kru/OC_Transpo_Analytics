# OC Transpo Transit Performance Analytics 

##  Project Overview
Public transit is a backbone of urban mobility. OC Transpo aims to provide safe, reliable, and convenient transit for Ottawa residents, with clear service targets:  
 99.5% on-time service for conventional buses  
 99% service reliability for O-Train  
 Acceptance of all Para Transpo trip requests  

This project analyzes OC Transpoâ€™s publicly available transit performance data to monitor current performance, uncover trends, and provide actionable insights for decision-making.

2. Service Reliability: Measure on-time performance and highlight routes that fall short of targets.  
3. Customer Service Insights: Track complaints or satisfaction trends (if data available).  
4. KPI Dashboard: Build an interactive Excel dashboard summarizing ridership, reliability, and other key metrics.  
5. Actionable Recommendations: Suggest improvements to enhance service reliability and customer experience.
